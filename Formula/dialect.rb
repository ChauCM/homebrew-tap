# Homebrew formula template for Dialect.
#
# Rendered by `tool/render_homebrew_formula.dart` at release time:
# fetches the GitHub release for the given tag, extracts each
# platform's SHA-256 from SHA256SUMS, and substitutes the {{TOKEN}}
# placeholders below. The rendered file lands at
# `ChauCM/homebrew-tap`'s `Formula/dialect.rb` via the release
# workflow's bump-PR step.
#
# Edit this template (not the rendered output) for layout changes.
